### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm a 22 year old builder, you can call me Î¼2 (Mew-Two)

I come from a background in Cybersecurity, started working at [NSA](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency) quite a few years ago. 
Since then, I've been focusing on working with cool people who move at a quicker pace, ideally on code that's for people instead of Gov's or Corporate!

In my free time, I love to [write](https://blog.Î¼2.com) and build silly projects.
