## You can call me μ2 (Mew-Two)

I come from a background in Cybersecurity, started working at [NSA](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency) quite a few years ago. 
Since then, I've been focusing on working with cool people who move at a quicker pace, ideally on code that's for people instead of Governments.

I'm a huge fan of distributed systems & microservice architecture.
In practice, that means I'm a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [React](https://react.dev/) maxi.

In my free time, I love to [write](https://blog.μ2.com) and build silly projects.

This is a new account, please be kind & give me some time to build up some new projects for you to look at.
I'm not taking anything old with me.

Here's some stuff I've done:
- [Nexum](https://github.com/0xMuTwo/nexum) SaaS project, vectorizing PDFs and using them in using a [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/) AI model via [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- [GloveTG](https://github.com/0xMuTwo/GloveTG_OpenSourced) Opensourced the Frontend for Telegram Blockchain app. Allowing purchasing crypto on Solana via text message.
- [Gauntlet](https://github.com/0xMuTwo/Gauntlet_Deployment) A ton of Bash scripts for automating the process of delpoying Solana Meme tokens.
